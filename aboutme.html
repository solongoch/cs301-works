            <li><span class="favourite_title">Oliver Twist (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18254.Oliver_Twist" target="_blank">GoodReads</a>)</span>
                <p><span class="embedded_text">Author: </span>Charles Dickens</p>
                <p>The story of Oliver Twist - orphaned, and set upon by evil and adversity from his first breath - shocked readers when it was published. After running away from the workhouse and pompous beadle Mr Bumble, Oliver finds himself lured into a den of thieves peopled by vivid and memorable characters - the Artful Dodger, vicious burglar Bill Sikes, his dog Bull's Eye, and prostitute Nancy, all watched over by cunning master-thief Fagin. Combining elements of Gothic Romance, the Newgate Novel and popular melodrama, Dickens created an entirely new kind of fiction, scathing in its indictment of a cruel society, and pervaded by an unforgettable sense of threat and mystery.</p>

                <p><span class="embedded_text">Author: </span>Paulo Coelho</p>
                <p>Paulo Coelho's masterpiece tells the mystical story of Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who yearns to travel in search of a worldly treasure. His quest will lead him to riches far different—and far more satisfying—than he ever imagined. Santiago's journey teaches us about the essential wisdom of listening to our hearts of recognizing opportunity and learning to read the omens strewn along life's path, and, most importantly, to follow our dreams.</p>
